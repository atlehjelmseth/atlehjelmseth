👨‍💻 I’m currently working on my portefolio, 👨‍🎓 I’m now learning front end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), 🤯 Next is Python.

⚡ Fun fact: I'm 36 years old, have a wife and a little dog named Ruth.

☎️ I have worked the last 18 years in sales, 💻with development and graphics on the side.

⌨️ I get triggered by solving problems, 🤯and like especially solving difficult problems.
